# Contact Book

## Project Overview

This is a simple contact book application built using React and Vite. The application allows users to manage their contacts, including adding, editing, and deleting contacts. The project was primarily developed with the help of Roo, an AI code assistant, and I am just checking out the capabilities of AI.
